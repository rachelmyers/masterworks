#### This is a sample repo that shows using Git and GitHub for things other than code.

This repo is where I keep files of pictures that I've drawn with the Paper by 53 app. Most of these pictures are by me, but I definitely love Pull Requests! To open a pull request:
- Fork this repository.
- Create a branch in your fork of the repository. (If you edit files in the web view, you can do this after making changes.)
- Make changes and commit the changes on the new branch. 
- Come back to this repository and [create a new Pull Request](https://github.com/rachelmyers/masterworks/compare/)!
